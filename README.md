Running a machine learning model to play Tetris using gymnasium


TODO: Add a reward function value to the graphs to show increase in performance over time. 
I need to understand more about the qnetwork
Also, the gap code has some flaws. I want to implement code that counts the total number of gaps after any lines are cleared rather than ones created by dropping a piece.
Next step is to impleent the rewards similar to the stanford paper with bumpiness, gaps, lines, and aggregate height. details here: https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/
For now, this code works well.
